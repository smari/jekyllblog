### Hello!

The premise of any personal website is that simply by being there you are already aware of certain things about the person in question. A secondary premise is that personal websites collapse personal contexts into a single mess that invariably comes across as self-aggrandizing bullcrap. 

In this case, you probably know me from one of my contexts â”€ 

* Member of the Icelandic Parliament
* Programmer / Free Software nut
* Essayist
* Human rights advocate
* Information security trainer
* Student pilot

... or something like that.

This website will not cater to your particular context, nor will it serve to fulfill self-aggrandizement, because it's not for you, it's for me.

Fine, I shall self-aggrandize on [my CV](/cv "CV").
