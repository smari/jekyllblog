### Hello!

The premise of any personal website is that simply by being there you are already aware of certain things about the person in question. A secondary premise is that personal websites collapse personal contexts into a single mess that invariably comes across as self-aggrandizing bullcrap. 

In this case, you probably know me from one of my contexts â”€ 

* Member of the Icelandic Parliament
* Programmer
* Essayist
* Political activist
* Human rights advocate
* Information security trainer
* Student pilot

... or something like that.
