[Arcade](https://rudiment.info/project/arcade/) is a cool project that examines satellite imagery 
for signs of artillery bombardment, calculates the location of artillery craters, the inbound 
trajectory of projectiles to aid identification of their possible origins of fire.

[Source code](https://github.com/Rudiment-Info/arcade) is available under BSD license. It has a 
clever Backronym. Hat tip to Tom Longley for letting me know about this.
