    the Constitution - Lessons from Iceland}
---

I was in Edinburgh some months ago visiting [Bella Caledonia][1]. I did 
this talk there, trying to give some history and background to the 
Icelandic constitutional process of 2010-2013, and putting it into a 
context of Scottish independence.

Suffice to say, I think Scotland should be independant. I say at least 
twice in this talk: EVERY reason that's been given for people to vote 
"no" is invalid.
