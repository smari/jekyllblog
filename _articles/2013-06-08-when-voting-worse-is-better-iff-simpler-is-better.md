I have written a response: It is worth asking here what Nijeboer means by “better”. Does it refer to a more democratic result, or a greater chance of participation? What does more democratic mean? What does simpler mean – as it appears that Nijeboer considers a simpler voting system to be “better,” as it is less exclusionary. From Nijeboer's article, it can only reasonably be inferred that “better” is defined as “more inclusive,” and that the simplest balloting mechanism is therefore the “best”. This is not a formal peer-reviewed response, but rather a citation-heavy semi-formal article. Read the response in full (PDF).
