Being the media has never been easier: see something, say something. Snap a pic, tweet it loud and clear. Splash it over the 'net, let it resound through all the social networks. But who, besides the government, is listening? Unless you paid the protection fee to boost your signal or managed to finagle your way into a large publication, your quality journalism will be lost in a sea of cat photos. Meanwhile, on the shores of that vast ocean, some governments are secretly plotting to shut you up for good. In this talk, which is a continuation of my "The Authoritarian Infoscape" series, I'll explore the conflicts brewing in media, surveillance and security as governments wise up to the Internet, and journalism drowns in it.
