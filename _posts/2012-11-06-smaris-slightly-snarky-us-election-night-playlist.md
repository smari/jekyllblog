For the Icelandic song, a quick and inadequate translation:

**In the booth**

Chorus:  
Brave, fallible, hesitant  
the cross to give.  
Lively, gifted, alert  
sages in the booth.

Four walls a rag and bar,  
Future of the threat and force.  
But we have only three  
upright &#8211; a velvet curtain.

Chorus:  
Brave, fallible, hesitant  
have much to give.  
Lively, gifted, alert  
barbarians in a booth.

Life with ink, text, blood  
the herd bets it all.  
Depressed county &#8211; proud nation  
listens afraid of provisional data.

Chorus:  
Brave, fallible, hesitant  
have everything to give.  
Valiant, brave, alert  
the future in a booth.
