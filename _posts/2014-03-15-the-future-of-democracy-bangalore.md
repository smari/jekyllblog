I recently held a talk about the future of democracy (as I see it) at the Center for Internet and 
Society in Bangalore, as my last stop during a month in India. It was a good group, lots of good 
questions, and hopefully not entirely useless answers.

Many thanks to the good people at CIS, TacticalTech and HasGeek for putting the event together!
