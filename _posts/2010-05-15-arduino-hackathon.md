Then I took over and ran very quickly through the different abstraction layers that underlie software: Nature, measurements, Maxwell&#8217;s equations, the lump matter discipline, semiconductors, logic gates, integrated circuits and software. I really like seeing the abstractions laid out like that, it makes the concept of programming seem so much more &#8230; real.

Then I demonstrated Processing, Fritzing and the Arduino development software, and we constructed a tiny example before breaking off into ad-hoc groups and hacking happily.

There will be many more hackathons like this. We&#8217;ve already started talking about doing another Arduino gig with slightly more advanced. But it&#8217;ll all be discussed at the Tuesday meeting &#8211; Grandagarður 16, 101 Reykjavík, 20:00.
