I&#8217;ve put together some worksheets that are intended as a kind of infrastructure and authority analysis kit for fledging Collapsonomicists. It&#8217;s still a very beta thing, but feel free to [download and play around][1]. The source files are SVG&#8217;s and can be [accessed on GitHub][2]. They use the Museo-slab 500 font, but probably shouldn&#8217;t. Feel free to fiddle with it and by all means push back.

The &#8220;slides&#8221; from my talk from [ISDT][3], &#8220;Infrastructure, Authority, and the Industrialization of the Internet&#8221;, is available here in[ SVG format][4] (warning: 26 MB!!). It&#8217;s really cool because it&#8217;s effectively an interactive web page for all intents and purposes, made in SVG. Works great in Google Chrome, haven&#8217;t tried it in other browsers. I decided not to embed it here as an <iframe> due to the massive size of the file. I used [Inkscape][5] with the [Sozi][6] plugin to make them; first time I&#8217;ve done that, and to be honest, Sozi needs a lot of UI work before I&#8217;ll want to use it again on anything big. I ran into a couple of weird errors with the presentation and fixing them turned out to be incredibly difficult and time consuming.

Enjoy.
