As of later today, my Icelandic blog posts will move from here to a new blog under the name &#8220;upplýsing&#8221; (enlightenment/information) on dv.is. This will bring more attention to my Icelandic posts while simplifying things for my readers who don&#8217;t speak Icelandic. It&#8217;ll also probably give me a lot more energy to *[publish what I]* write in general.

[Here is the blog][1].
