<p>I just spent a fair chunk of time trying to open a bank account in England. So far, no success - but I think I'm starting to understand the rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>You must have a bank account to open a bank account.</li>
<li>You must have a permanent address to open a bank account.</li>
<li>A permanent address is only provable as permanent if you have utilities bills or council tax statements.</li>
<li>Corporate apartments do not issue utilities bills or council tax statements.</li>
<li>You must have a bank account to rent an apartment.</li>
<li>You must have a <a href="http://www.no2id.net/">UK ID card</a> to prove your identity.</li>
<li>If you have no UK ID card, a passport will work, but it will take longer.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think that's it. If there are any further rules, they were not made known to me during my conversations this morning.</p>
<p>Rules of this sort are there for good reason... in theory. It's all done to try and make fraud harder. If a person isn't real, they can't do banking. Right? Fair enough.</p>
<p>But when people are designing these processes, it would be really nice if they checked their assumptions.&nbsp;Among&nbsp;the assumptions here are that everybody is British, lives in Britain and has done so for a long time. This means that new people attempting to bootstrap into the country are screwed unless they manage to navigate this convoluted bureaucracy.</p>
<p>It seems like the correct way to do this is something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Extract cash from your foreign bank account via ATM to pay rent.</li>
<li>Get utilities put in your name on the basis of your address.</li>
<li>Wait a month.</li>
<li>Take utilities bills to bank. Take your passport with you.</li>
<li>Hope that you don't get declined on the basis of having no credit history.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of this of course assumes that you will be able to find somebody willing to rent an apartment to somebody who doesn't have a UK bank account. If you can't, you're screwed.</p>
<p>Sometimes I get the impression that the EDL has already won. British bureaucracy, both the state and the corporate bureaucratic elements - much like the bureaucracy in most nation states I've encountered - is nationalistic and xenophobic.</p>
